Variables
==================================================================

subject - The ID of the test subject
activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

Labels:
======================================

- WALKING (value 1): subject was walking during the test

- WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test

- WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test

- SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting during the test

- STANDING (value 5): subject was standing during the test

- LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down during the test



The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 

- 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 

- 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
